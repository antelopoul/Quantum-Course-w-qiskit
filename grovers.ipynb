    "The purpose of Grover's algorithm is to solve unstructured search problems. Such a problem can be for example trying to find the combination (referred to as the winner state |<i>w</i>>) that unlocks a lock. It might not be easy to find the correct combination |<i>w</i>> among all possible combinations N, but it is fairly simple to validate a given combination and see if it is correct or not. This algorithm requires on average N/2 (O(N)) computations on a classical computer, as each of the N combinations needs to be tested one at a time. On the other hand, Grover's algorithm uses the fact that we can manipulate many qubits' superpositions at the same time to speed up the process to O(<span>&radic;N</span>).\n",
