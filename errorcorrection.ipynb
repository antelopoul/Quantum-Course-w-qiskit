    "This is an implementation for phase flip error correction.\n",

    "This code is inspired by the following quantum computing tutorial (https://quantumcomputinguk.org/tutorials/quantum-error-correction-phase-flip-code-in-qiskit). Throughout the code, there will be comments describing the process and the circuit creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the hardware of quantum computers, it is possible for errors such as unwanted bit and phase flips to occur on qubits. In classical computers, if we are suspecting corruption of a bit or many bits, we can save copies to secure it/them. On the other hand, in quantum computers when a qubit is in a superposition between |0> and |1> (|ψ>= α|0> + β|1>), then it is impossible to copy it, which is also known as the no-cloning theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to protect our qubit from potential errors, we can design a circuit that uses ancillary qubits and the property of entanglement. This circuit proves that it is possible to correct a potential unwanted phase flip, by inducing a phase flip on the original qubit q<sub>0</sub> and then showing that at the end of the circuit, this error is corrected for.\n",

    "Now that our three qubits are entangled, we apply the hadamart gate on all of them. The reason we apply Hadamard gates before and after our Z gate is that we are practically transforming our circuit into a bit flip error correction circuit. I tried doing the math for a one qubit HZH and I got that HZH = X. Thus, our phase flip error correction circuit turns into a bit flip error correction circuit, while we still have our Z gate to simulate a potential phase flip. An intuition for this is that its not practically possible to observe a phase flip, whereas we can observe a bit flip. Here is the first application of H gates:"
