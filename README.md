<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Introduction
This repository contains two exercises on Quantum Computing:
- Bit / Phase Flip Error correction
- Grover's Algorithm


### Prerequisites

Before we start, you will need to install qiskit library in order to make the quantum circuits and simulation.
An account on IBM Quantum Platform is recommended but not mandatory to run in real-time the code.
* qiskit
  ```
  pip install qiskit
  ```
